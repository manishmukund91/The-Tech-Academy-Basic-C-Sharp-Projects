# The Tech Academy Basic C# Projects

This repository contains all my basic C# and .NET projects created during The Tech Academy course. Each project demonstrates key concepts such as variables, loops, classes, inheritance, exception handling, LINQ, and more.

These projects form part of my software development portfolio.
